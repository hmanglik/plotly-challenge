# In this assignment we built an interactive dashboard on the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. Our goal was to find the kinds of OTUs present in each sample (ie. a person), as well as the demographic information for that specific person. Once we had an interactive dashboard, we were supposed to deploy it on [GitHub Pages](https://hmanglik.github.io/plotly-challenge/).

**Plotly.js**
# In the app.js file, we used Plotly.js functionality to plot a bar chart, a bubble chart, and a gauge.
